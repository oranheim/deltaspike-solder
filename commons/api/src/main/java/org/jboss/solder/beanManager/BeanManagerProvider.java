/**
 * <p>
 * {@link BeanManagerProvider} is the SPI for {@link BeanManagerLocator} which
 * allows third parties to register a way of obtaining the {@link BeanManager}
 * outside of CDI managed objects.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * Solder provides a number of built in providers, including:
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link DefaultJndiBeanManagerProvider}</li>
 * <li>{@link JBossJndiBeanManagerProvider}</li>
 * <li>{@link ServletContainerJndiBeanManagerProvider}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * Providers can specify a precedence, allowing a provider to be a "last resort"
 * provider only.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * Precedence about 100 is suggested for providers that should always be used.
 * Precedence below 10 is suggested for providers of last resort.
