    <title>Conversation Usage in EL</title>
    <para>
      CDI exposes the conversation to EL via the name <literal>javax.enterprise.context.conversation</literal>. Seam
      Faces adds an alias to make this a little more convient for page authors. The alias Seam Faces provides is
      simply <literal>conversation</literal>.
    </para>

  <section id="faces.conversation_management">
    <title>Conversation Management</title>

    <para>
      CDI Conversations can be started and stopped easily in Seam Faces using annotations, respectifully 
      <literal>@Begin</literal> and <literal>@End</literal>. Both of these have some extra properties that can be
      used to configure the conversation.
    </para>

    <para>
      Common to both annotations is the <literal>permit</literal> attribute. This is an array of Exception classes
      which if encountered during the method execution, will still allow the conversation to begin, or end. By default,
      any exception encountered will either prohibit the conversation from beginning or ending.
    </para>

    <section id="faces.conversation_management.begin">
      <title><literal>@Begin</literal></title>
      <para>
        The <literal>@Begin</literal> annotation has the <literal>id</literal> property
        which can be used to provide an id for the conversation, instead of the default. The <literal>timeout</literal>
        property is used to set the timeout for the conversation in milliseconds.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="faces.conversation_management.end">
      <title><literal>@End</literal></title>
      <para>
        <literal>@End</literal> has no additional properties.
      </para>
