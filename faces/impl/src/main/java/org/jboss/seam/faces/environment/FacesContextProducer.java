/**
 * <p>
 * A producer which retrieves the {@link FacesContext} for the current request of the JavaServer Faces application by calling
 * {@link FacesContext#getCurrentInstance()} and stores the result as a request-scoped bean instance.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * This producer allows the {@link FacesContext} to be injected:

 * <pre>
 * &#064;Inject
 * FacesContext ctx;
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * QUESTION is it correct to use a @RequestScoped producer? If it is @Dependent, then a developer could unknowingly bind it to a
 * wider-scoped bean
